From a brisk Portland walk to a warm AcroYoga welcome, you make your way to the Oregon Convention center for the 6th annual Divine Play AcroYoga Fest. Greeted by the smiling faces of AcroYoga friends from around the globe, you enter the convention center that has been transformed into a golden ticket to the largest and most diverse gathering of AcroYogis in the world.

## Wristband

You get your wristband promptly and peer beyond the conference room doors to witness for the first time what looks to be a room packed full of AcroYogis, healers, acrobats, and yogis bound for the sweetest three days of practice, technique building, and absolute, undeniable, divine play. Communities from Dallas to the Dutch are practicing in one place, under one roof, unified by the supportive connection AcroYoga brings to the globe.

## Divine Play
This year’s Divine Play was the largest yet, with more than 1000 attendees of all ages, sizes, creeds, and colors from over thirty countries. With a record number of classes, participants had the chance to participate in everything from “Hand to Hand Entry and Exit” to “Therapeutic Release for Head Neck and Shoulders.” Teachers from different lineages came to share their wisdom, from Det and Jim’s high flying acrobatics to Benjamin Marantz from Hawaii, revealing the soft side of inversion therapy with his AcroSage technique. Regardless of where you were from or the experience of your practice, there was something for everybody.

## Conclusion
After 2 days of nonstop AcroYoga it was time for some entertainment. The AcroYoga talent show this year was the most outstanding yet!  The show included some of the most sophisticated choreographed dance and drama performances the community has seen. With performances ranging from high flying hand to hand acrobatics to an AcroYoga vedic philosophy play. Closing ceremonies only beckoned forth the next series of incredible connections, and inspired AcroYoga International’s next moves, which we share with you here.
