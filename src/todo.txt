- Show proposal owner in the Proposal page
- Comment.owner should be a GlobalUser, not Member
- Use ImageCropField
- In Revision template, include a link to the latest version of the proposal
- when updating a review, delete all comments
- allow to change image when editing a proposal
- Make upload automatic when you change the image in the new proposal form
- Check that url for the goal/profile is not used
- slug should only be unique per goal
- Advise member that their profile is totally public
- Use now() timestamp from the db server
- When leaving a Goal as a member, confirm that all Proposals are deleted (or make them orphans that can be adopted?)
