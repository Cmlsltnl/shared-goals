Later

- Ensure that uploaded images never override real images. Maybe uploaded images can go
into a suggestions_inbox folder
- Use now() timestamp from the db server
- When leaving a Goal as a member, confirm that all Suggestion are deleted (or make them orphans that can be adopted?)
- Advise member that their profile is totally public
