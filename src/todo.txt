- how does cropping really work, what's up with the details file
- Ensure that uploaded images never override real images. Maybe uploaded images can go
into a suggestions_inbox folder
- Use now() timestamp from the db server
- When leaving a Goal as a member, confirm that all Suggestion are deleted (or make them orphans that can be adopted?)
- Advise member that their profile is totally public
- use markdown in reviews and comments, but with a more modest style
- Highlight currently selected main menu item
- suggestion preview button
- garbage collect revisions that have no reviews and are not the latest one
