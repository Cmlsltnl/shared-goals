- slug should only be unique per goal
- Advise member that their profile is totally public
- Use now() timestamp from the db server
- Make upload automatic when you change the image in the new proposal form
- When leaving a Goal as a member, confirm that all Proposals are deleted (or make them orphans that can be adopted?)
