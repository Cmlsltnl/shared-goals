- when uploading a new image in a draft proposal, delete the previous one
(make sure the deleted image is not somehow used for another proposal)
- split out code to handle posting comments in the ProposalView
- see if a handling posts can become some kind of Template Method
- when updating a review, delete all comments
- test if making the cropping dimensions bigger affects stored image size
- try to make image bigger in the new proposal form
- Advise member that their profile is totally public
- Use now() timestamp from the db server
- When leaving a Goal as a member, confirm that all Proposals are deleted (or make them orphans that can be adopted?)
- Use ImageCropField
