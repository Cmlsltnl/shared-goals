Later

- do not update a suggestion, create a new one with the same slug. Merge revision into suggestion. Do also not update review, create new ones. When showing a review, add a button to view old comments.

- set maximum size for uploaded image
- restrict acceptable user names (so that we can lookup profiles properly)
- Ensure that uploaded images never override real images. Maybe uploaded images can go
into a suggestions_inbox folder
- Use now() timestamp from the db server
- Advise member that their profile is totally public
- use markdown in reviews and comments, but with a more modest style
- garbage collect revisions that have no reviews and are not the latest one
- add a penalty to the mean rating that is higher for suggestions with few reviews

How-to

- sudo /etc/init.d/nginx status
- supervisord -n -c supervisord.conf
