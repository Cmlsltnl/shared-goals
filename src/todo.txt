Later

- set maximum size for uploaded image
- restrict accetable user names (so that we can lookup profiles properly)
- learn how jcrop myself. How does cropping really work, what's up with the details file?
- Ensure that uploaded images never override real images. Maybe uploaded images can go
into a suggestions_inbox folder
- Use now() timestamp from the db server
- Advise member that their profile is totally public
- use markdown in reviews and comments, but with a more modest style
- Highlight currently selected main menu item
- garbage collect revisions that have no reviews and are not the latest one
- add a penalty to the mean rating that is higher for suggestions with few reviews
- bug: when submitting a invalid suggestion, the image is no longer shown

How-to

- sudo /etc/init.d/nginx status
- supervisord -n -c supervisord.conf
