# Shared Goals

Shared Goals is a social network that helps members reach a shared goal.

## Which kind of goal?

The goal can be almost anything, from something personal such as "I want to get fit" to something global as "Improve the popularity of checkers".

## How does it work?

a) you start by creating a goal (e.g. "become a good piano player") or joining an existing one
b) you can then create suggestions for achieving the goal (e.g. "do the Hanon exercises 15 minutes each day"). A suggestion basically has the shape of a blog post so you can
elaborate on your idea.
c) other users can give feedback by rating your suggestion and writing a review. We expect highly rated suggestions to receive more attention.
d) any user can comment on these reviews (and on each others' comments), so a discussion can take place

## How does this help?

a) to achieve any goal, it motivates is there is a community around it
b) the network wil show you which suggestions (to achieve the goal) have worked for many people
c) by discussing the suggestions, the community will be able to improve on them
d) you will probably see suggestions you had not thought of before
e) you will see who is applying a suggestion, which can motivate you to form a new habit (or maintain an existing one)

## What's next

There are many potential improvements of this platform. One of them is the ability to automatically find people and suggestions that match your interest.
